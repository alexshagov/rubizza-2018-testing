### Rules you must follow

* Do not stick to one kind of tests
* Know your instruments
* Convert production bugs into tests
* Don't believe tests coverage
* Don't forget about edge cases

### Much more useful metrics

1) PDWT (Percent of Developers who Writes Tests)
2) PBCNT (Percent of Bugs that Create New Tests)
3) PTVB (Percent of Tests that Verify Behavior and not implementation)
4) PTD (Percent of Tests that are Deterministic to total tests) [note: should only fail when there're problems with business code]

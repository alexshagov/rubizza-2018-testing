### Basic principles

* Write tests with different level of granularity
* The more high-level you get fewer tests you should 

Note: everything else is demagoguery

### Internal and external quality

* External -- how the system meets the requirements of users and customers (Increases with well-written E2E tests)
* Internal -- how the system meets the requirements of its developers (Increases with well-written Unit tests)

Note: internal quality is about __loose coupling_ and __high cohesion_.
